## Shell Scripting - Shell Variables and Expansions

This repository contains a collection of shell scripts that demonstrate various concepts related to shell variables and expansions in Unix-like systems.

## Table of Contents

0-alias
Create an alias named ls that executes rm (wirldcard).

1-hello_you
Create a script that prints "hello" followed by the current Linux user's name.

2-path
Add /action to the PATH environment variable. /action should be the last directory the shell looks into when searching for a program.

3-paths
Create a script that counts the number of directories in the PATH environment variable.

4-global_variables
Create a script that lists environment variables.

5-local_variables
Create a script that lists both local variables and environment variables, including functions.

6-create_local_variable
Create a script that defines a new local variable named BEST with the value "School".

7-create_global_variable
Create a script that defines a new global variable named BEST with the value "School".

8-true_knowledge
Write a script that prints the result of adding 128 to the value stored in the environment variable TRUEKNOWLEDGE, followed by a new line.

9-divide_and_rule
Write a script that prints the result of dividing the value stored in the environment variable POWER by the value stored in the environment variable DIVIDE, followed by a new line.

10-love_exponent_breath
Write a script that calculates and displays the result of raising the value stored in the environment variable BREATH to the power of the value stored in the environment variable LOVE, followed by a new line.

11-binary_to_decimal
Write a script that converts a binary number stored in the environment variable BINARY to its decimal equivalent and displays the result, followed by a new line.

12-combinations
Create a script that generates and prints all possible combinations of two lowercase letters (a to z), excluding "oo," one combination per line, in alphabetical order.

13-print_float

100-decimal_to_hexadecimal
Write a script that converts a decimal number stored in the environment variable DECIMAL to its hexadecimal equivalent and displays the result, followed by a new line.

101-rot13
Create a script that encodes and decodes text using the rot13 encryption algorithm, assuming ASCII. It reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

102-odd
Write a script that prints every other line from the input, starting with the first line. It reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

103-water_and_stir
Create a script that adds two numbers stored in environment variables WATER and STIR, with each number represented in a custom base, and then prints the result in another custom base.
