## Shell Basics Project

This project is a collection of shell scripts intended to introduce and reinforce fundamental shell scripting ideas in Linux. The scripts handle everything from basic file and directory management to working with symbolic links and file formats.


## Function

The goal of this project is to help users become adept in Linux shell scripting. Users will receive hands-on experience with common shell commands as well as learn how to develop and execute their own shell scripts by completing these assignments. This project is a great place to start if you want to learn about Linux system management, automation, or software development.


## Installation and Use

You'll need a Linux environment, preferably Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, to run these scripts.

LTS Ubuntu 20.04. 

Here's where to begin:

1. Make a copy of the repository: **alx-system_engineering-devops/**

2. Go to the Project Directory:**
cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics

The following syntax can be used to run each script:
./script-name

As an example:
./0-current_working_directory


## Requirements

These scripts do not rely on anything other than what is available in a regular Linux system. They are intended to function with the fundamental shell commands included in most Linux distributions.


## Additional Information

-As indicated in the instructions for this task, all scripts in this project are limited to two lines of code.

-As noted in the tasks, the usage of certain shell capabilities, such as shell variables, is prohibited in some scripts.

-When running scripts, especially those that entail file and directory manipulation, exercise caution because they might have a substantial influence on your system.

Please feel free to investigate and employ these programs to help you improve your shell scripting abilities. Have fun scripting!
